      <h2>What is Vibe Coding?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Vibe Coding</strong> is more than just writing code — it’s a creative mindset. It’s about building with purpose, energy, and style. Whether you're coding late at night with your favorite music on, designing smooth UI transitions, or crafting clever functions, you’re doing more than programming — you’re vibing.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Vibe Coding, I share my journey as a developer, breaking down complex concepts into simple visuals, tutorials, and projects that inspire. I believe in making learning fun, expressive, and visually meaningful — because code isn’t just logic, it’s also art.
